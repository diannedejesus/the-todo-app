# The To Do List
This application is built with simplicity in mind, it is all about getting the person focused on what needs to get done, without them getting distracted with other items including the ones on their to-do list.

 ## What problem is this software addressing? Who will be using it? 
This software is designed to be a personal productivity application. Tailored to my style of work. Ultimately serving as an ongoing side project that I can use to explore new technologies, frameworks, languages styles, logic, ect.

## What is the current solution?
Currently the projects code/backend is all implemented in JS with a single file. The main server file. It has a seperate folder for the view which is done in EJS. It also has a public folder which contains the CSS and JS for the view.

## Core Vision
My goal is to have a place I can dump all the tasks I have or come to mind for a project but have the application only show the most critical tasks or the tasks I am currently working on. Everything else is hidden away safe for the next planning session. 
The style is suppose to replicate physical to do lists, in a bullet journal esk type look.

## Current Mission
I plan to redo the whole application. First will be reorganizing the whole code. Then I can change the view to something like React and posible add more features.

### Ideas
- implement in MVC 
- reduce the area dedicated to events, it over powers the tasks which is what I really want to focus on and events are meant to be just a reminder.
- possible integrate this with other software. calendars github
- possible make an interactive mode where <!---recruiters---> people can reorder and/or suggest tasks then send it to me. So they can play around with the app and encite a call to action.
- switch to react to allow a more customizable UI
- Change how completed items look, currently it feel distracting
- Maybe add stats for tracking productivity week over week. Showing increases and decreases.
